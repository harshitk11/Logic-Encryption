cone_original.cpp is the original code for finding out the cone of dependency of the outputs. It stores the cone of dependency of all the outputs including flipflops in a single file.

cone.cpp finds out the cone of dependency of all the outputs and stores the cone containing DFF, NOT, OR, NOT, AND, NAND in separate files.

cone1.cpp just finds the cone of dependency of all the outputs and stores the cone of each output in a separate file. A bug is fixed in cone1.cpp from line 205-224 which includes the variable bad_flag.


cone_original.cpp and cone.cpp are in redundant code.



Procedure for getting the key gates for the paper:

<circuit_name>

---> run dependency1.cpp ----------> /hope_key_node.text
			 ----------> NO_HOPE_KEYNODE = 200
			  
---> run keyGate.cpp ----------> Line 203 /hope_key_node.text
		     ----------> NO_HOPE_KEYNODE = 200
		     ----------> NO_OF_OUTPUT
		     
---> Delete contents of <circuit_name>/dependency

---> run dependency1.cpp ----------> /hope_key_node_final.text
			 ----------> NO_HOPE_KEYNODE = 128

---> run keyGate.cpp ----------> Line 203 /hope_key_node_final.text
		     ----------> NO_HOPE_KEYNODE = 128
		     ----------> NO_OF_OUTPUT



========================================================================================================================
-> Check hope_key_node.cpp in the HOPE folder which does the hope simulation and gives the output hope_key_node.text
-> In read_inNum.cpp you have to change the number of output in line number 94			 
			 
=========================================================================================================================
-> inNum: Contains the list of outputs and the number of nodes in their cone of dependency
-> inNum_sort: Contains the list of outputs in the descending order of the number of nodes in their cone of dependency	(output of read_inNum.cpp)
-> shorlisted_output: contains the list of shortlisted outputs (with maximum overlap). Selected from inNum_sort
-> keyNodes_sort: contains the set of key nodes obtained after the first step (i.e. maximum overlapping cone)
-> hope_key_node.txt : contains the list of nodes having maximum fault impact as given by hope simulation tool as well as having maximum overlap
